XML::Stream v.13

This module provides you with access to XML Streams.  An XML Stream
is just that.  A stream of XML over a connection between two computers.
For more information about XML Streams, and the group that created them,

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

REQUIREMENTS

  Unicode::String - a bug in perl 5.6 makes this a requirement for ALL
                    versions of Perl.  Maybe I can get rid of this someday.

STATUS

  Added support for outgoing HTTP connections.  If the server can accept
HTTP connections, then the socket is setup andkept alive while you send
and receive XML.  This even works through HTTP proxies as the proxy
thinks that the document is still loading and so keep the connection
alive.

  With a previous release I added in a new Parser that the module uses to
parse the incoming streams.  This new Parser is a SAX parser based off
of the one written by Jeremie Miller.
  Also with this release I've started adding in the ability for
XML::Stream to listen on a port and accept incoming streams.  This feature
in still under development so don't try and use it yet...
  Finally, I've started working on a DTD parser and verifier for the
module, but it is by no means even close to being done.  So don't even look
into using it. =)

Please send any bug reports to reatmon@jabber.org.
