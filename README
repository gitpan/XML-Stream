XML::Stream v1.11

This module provides you with access to XML Streams.  An XML Stream
is just that.  A stream of XML over a connection between two computers.
For more information about XML Streams, and the group that created them,

STATUS

  With this release I've added in a new Parser that the module uses to
parse the incoming streams.  This new Parser is a SAX parser based off
of the one written by Jeremie Miller.
  Also with this release I've started adding in the ability for
XML::Stream to listen on a port and accept incoming streams.  This feature
in still under development so don't try and use it yet...
  Finally, I've started working on a DTD parser and verifier for the
module, but it is by no means even close to being done.  So don't even look
into using it. =)

Please send any bug reports to reatmon@jabber.org.
