1.05
====
  - Fixed sport where Stream would die if it could not resolve your full
    hostname.  Now it just reverts back to the result of hostname() if
    it can' look up the full name.
  - Initialized some variables to get rid of warnings with perl -w.

1.04
====
  - Changed version scheme to allow Perl to check for it.

1.0c
====
  - I think I got the bug in ParseStream that removes the parse coming in
    while a parse is already in progress.
  - Fixed major bug in Process.  If you got a tag in the middle of the tag
    it would cause an XML error.
  - Also, if another parse came in during another parse, the second parse
    tree would get built under the current parse tree and everything would
    grind to a halt.

1.0b
====
  - Improved error handling by creating GetErrorCode and SetErrorCode.
    These functions allow the caller to get some information about why
    Process or Connect returned undef.
  - Added error checking if a <stream:error> is sent.  This will call
    SetErrorCode and return undef.

1.0a
====
  - Version bump.
  - Changed method of handling timeouts in the Connect and Process block.
    The timeout from the Connect is no longer remembered in the Process
    and used.  This method has improved the speed of the module greatly.
  - Fixed bug where the Process was not properly handling a connection 
    breakdown.  It now returns undef, or "", when the server dies or the
    connection is dropped.

0.1b
====
  - Added XML::Stream::Namespace to make writting Perl modules for other
    namepsaces possible.  (This is highly alpha...)
  - Added Disconnect function to send closing tag and shut the stream down.
  - Added documentation list of methods in Stream.pm.

0.1a
====
  - First version.
  - Supports connecting to a server, opening a stream, and receiving from that
    stream.
