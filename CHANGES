1.0
===
  - Version bump.
  - Changed method of handling timeouts in the Connect and Process block.
    The timeout from the Connect is no longer remembered in the Process
    and used.  This method has improved the speed of the module greatly.
  - Fixed bug where the Process was not properly handling a connection 
    breakdown.  It now returns undef, or "", when the server dies or the
    connection is dropped.

0.1b
====
  - Added XML::Stream::Namespace to make writting Perl modules for other
    namepsaces possible.  (This is highly alpha...)
  - Added Disconnect function to send closing tag and shut the stream down.
  - Added documentation list of methods in Stream.pm.

0.1a
====
  - First version.
  - Supports connecting to a server, opening a stream, and receiving from that
    stream.
